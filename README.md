## AutoM00sic is (read: could've been) a gr8 way to automatically check for new uploads by artists and download them. uses youtube-dl and spotdl. I don't need to use this any more so dont expect new or advanced features.

# how 2 use:

just run script and fill out first time prompt. dont worry if u make a typo, u can just change the website value in the dat file.  

##If you want to maintain this project: 
# TODO:

GUI 

Add support for multiple websites per artist

Use 'smarter' content downloading ie no duplicates.

Recursive directory(album)  sorting/reading.
